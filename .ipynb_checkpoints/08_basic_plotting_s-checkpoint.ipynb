    "There are two types of plots: exploratory and explanatory. **Exploratory** plots are useful when you are trying to determine what direction you pursue in your analysis. They can be simple plots, but they still need enough detail to be self-documenting. Plotting data on a graph is an important part of preparing it for analysis. Descriptive statistics are helpful but don't show the whole picture. Our first example will show why.\n",
